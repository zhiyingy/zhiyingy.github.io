## Summary:
For this project, we will implement different types of locks to test the performance of various synchronization primitives.
Specifically, we will be implementing test-and-set lock, test-and-test-and-set lock, ticket locks and queue-based locks. 
If time permitted, we will implement a lock free AVL tree and compare the performance.
