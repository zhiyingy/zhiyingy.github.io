# Checkpoint

## Updated schedule for coming weeks:
week 4 (Nov 18th - Nov 24th): implementation of lock-free AVL trees (rebalance(): together, search(): together)

week 5 (Nov 25th - Dec 1st): continued implementation of lock-free AVL trees (insert(): Zhiying, delete(): Hongyi)

week 6 (Dec 2nd - Dec 8th): comparative analysis of different implementations of AVL trees. 

week 7 (Dec 9th - Dec 15th): final report and presentation.

## Things we have completed:
We have completed AVL trees using fine-grained locks with different locking mechanisms mentioned in lecture. We have written some basic tests, and our implementation of AVL trees with fine-grained locks works properly with these tests. 

## Goals:
We switched what we were supposed to do on weeks 2-3 and weeks 4-5. The reason was that find-grained locks were easier to implement than lock-free data structures. Both of the team members were a little busy in the past two weeks (midterms, projects in other classes, presentations), so we instead implemented find-grained locking first. Both members are done with all the midterms this semester, so we believe we will have more free times in the following weeks, and we believe we will be able to produce all our deliverables. 

## What to show at the poster session:
We plan to show the comparative analysis of different locking implementations of AVL trees at the poster session.

## Preliminary results:
Since we have only implemented fine-grained locks, it is not possible to do the comparative analysis, so we are unable to show preliminary results at this time. 

## Issues and concerns:
As of now, the biggest challenge is that our group members are unable to meet this week due to Thanksgiving. But since both members are done with their midterms, and one member only has one final exam, we are confident that we will successfully finish the project.
