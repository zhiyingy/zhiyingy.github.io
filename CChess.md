## Chinese Chess Solver
## Summary
For this project, we will implement a Chinese Chess Solver using Minimax, Alpha-beta Pruning. When implemented, this solver can be used to play against human players. Chinese chess has more complex rules and larger branching factor than Chess, thus it is more challenging to implement. If we have time, we would implement an parallel MonteCarlo Tree Search for the solver.

## Background
Chinese chess (Xiangqi) is a popular game in China that requires strategies and learnings. It contains seven types of pieces, and each type has different moving rules. <br\>
