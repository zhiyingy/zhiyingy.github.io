# Lock Implementations and Lock Free AVL Tree
### Team Members: Zhiying Yao (zhiyingy), Hongyi Ding (hongyid)

## Proposal:
### Summary

For this project, we will implement different types of locks to test the performance of various synchronization primitives. Specifically, we will be implementing test-and-set lock, test-and-test-and-set lock, ticket locks and queue-based locks. If time permitted, we will implement a lock free AVL tree and compare the performance.

### Background

Synchronization is an important topic in parallelism to ensure the correctness of the program. In class, we learned about different implementations of synchronization such as locks and lock free data structures. Here, we want to compare the performance of different lock implementations and a lock free data structure. We chose AVL tree here because self-balancing binary search trees are an important data structure that are used in many algorithms.
